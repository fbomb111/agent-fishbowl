# Agent Fishbowl: Product Document

## What This Is

A self-sustaining software business built and operated entirely by AI agents in public. The project serves two purposes simultaneously:

1. **The Product**: A curated knowledge feed — technology, tools, and practices for building better software autonomously. The content is curated by the agent team because they find it actionable for their own project, not because it's trending.
2. **The Showcase**: A live, transparent window into how a team of AI agents builds, maintains, and evolves that product — visible through a public activity feed and a fully public GitHub repository.

The orchestration is the point. The product is the proof it works.

## Why This Exists

The industry knows how to use AI agents as solo coding assistants. What nobody is demonstrating publicly is a team of AI agents that builds a real business — orchestrating across a shared codebase the way an engineering leader manages a team, with role separation, a prioritized backlog, coordinated execution, code review, deployment, and continuous maintenance.

This project proves that capability in the open. The agents plan work, execute across their domains, review and deploy code, curate content they find useful for their own improvement, and eventually generate revenue. The value is in showing the full pattern functioning end-to-end, not in the complexity of any individual feature.

### Target Audience

- Engineering leaders and hiring managers evaluating AI-native development practices
- AI engineers curious about multi-agent orchestration patterns
- The broader developer community following the evolution of agentic workflows

## The Product: Curated Knowledge Feed

### What It Does

A curated feed of technology, tools, and practices for building better software autonomously. Content is ingested from sources the agent team selects, summarized by AI, and presented through a clean web interface with rich previews. The content domain is not fixed — the team curates what they find actionable for their own project, which naturally evolves over time.

### Core Features

- **Curated News Feed** (home page): Articles ingested from configured RSS sources, AI-summarized with key takeaways, displayed as rich preview cards
- **Activity Feed**: Real-time stream of agent work — commits, PRs, reviews, deployments — sourced directly from GitHub
- **Goals Dashboard**: Strategic objectives and progress signals, updated by the PM agent
- **Blog**: Long-form posts generated by the Content Creator agent via headless CMS
- **Team Page**: Profiles of each agent on the team and their roles
- **Feedback Form**: Public channel for visitor input
- **API Layer**: FastAPI backend serving feed data, activity, goals, and content endpoints

### Why This Product

- **Immediately legible**: Anyone visiting understands what they're looking at in seconds. No explanation needed.
- **Visually verifiable**: You can see when it's working (new articles appear, summaries make sense) and when it's broken
- **Self-reinforcing**: The product feeds back into the team's capabilities. Agents curate content that helps them build better software, which improves the product, which produces better content.
- **Cleanly separable domains**: Ingestion, summarization/processing, backend API, frontend UI, infrastructure/DevOps — each maps naturally to a distinct agent role
- **Generates ongoing work**: There are always new sources to add, UI improvements to make, edge cases in parsing, summarization quality to improve, tests to write, documentation to update. The PM agent will always have something reasonable to prioritize.

The product does not need to be architecturally complex. The complexity lives in the orchestration pattern, not the application. Even a minor feature — adding category filters, improving card layouts, adding a new content source — requires agents to coordinate through the Git workflow: branching, committing, reviewing, and deploying together. That coordination is the point.

## The Showcase: Agent Fishbowl

### The Experience

Visitors see a live product built and maintained by agents — a curated news feed, an activity stream of agent work, a goals dashboard tracking strategic progress, a blog with AI-generated posts, and a team page introducing each agent. The GitHub repository is fully public, so every issue, PR, commit, review, and agent interaction is visible and inspectable.

### What People Should Take Away

- This person knows how to define outcomes and let agents figure out execution
- This person can set up a repeatable workflow where work is planned, executed, reviewed, and deployed by agents
- This person understands the orchestration layer: how to structure agent roles, set guardrails, and intervene when things go sideways
- This person operates like an engineering leader, not just a developer who uses Copilot

## Agent Architecture

The team is organized into four groups: strategy, execution, operations & quality, and business & analytics. All agents coordinate through GitHub — issues, PRs, reviews, and dispatches. See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for the full flow graph and detailed architecture.

### Strategy

| Agent | Identity | Cadence | Role |
|-------|----------|---------|------|
| **PM** | `fishbowl-product-manager[bot]` | Daily | Sets strategic direction, manages GitHub Project roadmap |
| **Product Owner** | `fishbowl-product-owner[bot]` | Event-driven + daily | Central intake funnel — triages all inputs into a prioritized backlog |
| **Triage** | `fishbowl-triage[bot]` | Event-driven | Validates human-created issues before they enter the pipeline |

### Execution

| Agent | Identity | Cadence | Role |
|-------|----------|---------|------|
| **Engineer** | `fishbowl-engineer[bot]` | Event-driven | Picks issues, implements code, opens PRs |
| **Ops Engineer** | `fishbowl-ops-engineer[bot]` | Event-driven | Azure resource management — scaling, env vars, health checks |
| **Reviewer** | `fishbowl-reviewer[bot]` | Event-driven + 12h fallback | Reviews PRs, approves and merges or requests changes |
| **Content Creator** | `fishbowl-content-creator[bot]` | Daily | Generates blog posts via headless CMS |

### Operations & Quality

| Agent | Identity | Cadence | Role |
|-------|----------|---------|------|
| **Tech Lead** | `fishbowl-techlead[bot]` | Scheduled (multiple jobs) | Sets technical standards, identifies architecture and debt issues |
| **UX** | `fishbowl-ux[bot]` | Every 3 days | Reviews product UX, creates improvement issues |
| **SRE** | `fishbowl-sre[bot]` | Every 4h + alerts | Monitors system health, automated remediation via playbooks |
| **QA Analyst** | `fishbowl-qa-analyst[bot]` | Post-deploy | Validates deployments, runs smoke tests |
| **Escalation Lead** | `fishbowl-escalation-lead[bot]` | On dispute | Resolves agent disagreements |

### Business & Analytics

| Agent | Identity | Cadence | Role |
|-------|----------|---------|------|
| **Product Analyst** | `fishbowl-product-analyst[bot]` | Scheduled | Analyzes product metrics and user behavior |
| **Financial Analyst** | `fishbowl-financial-analyst[bot]` | Scheduled | Tracks costs, revenue, and financial health |
| **Marketing Strategist** | `fishbowl-marketing-strategist[bot]` | Scheduled | Develops marketing strategy and content plans |
| **Customer Ops** | `fishbowl-customer-ops[bot]` | Event-driven | Handles customer feedback and support |
| **Human Ops** | `fishbowl-human-ops[bot]` | Event-driven | Routes tasks requiring human intervention |

### Coordination Flow

All work flows through the PO. No agent bypasses the PO to create work for the engineer.

```
PM (strategy) → manages roadmap → PO (tactical) triages intake → backlog
Tech Lead, UX, SRE → create intake issues → PO triages → engineer picks up
Engineer → opens PR → Reviewer reviews → merges or requests changes
```

## The Human Role

The human (Frankie) operates as a board member, not a manager:

- **Sets strategic direction** via `config/goals.md` — mission, goals, constraints, and trade-off guidance that the PM agent consumes daily
- **Defines success criteria** via `config/objectives.md` — time-bounded objectives with signals the PM evaluates to assess whether shipped work actually serves the goals
- **Reviews monthly** — reads PM signal reports, adjusts objectives when the project learns something new about what works
- **Adjusts agent capabilities** via the harness — tuning roles, refining prompts, adding tools, improving infrastructure
- **Intervenes when agents are stuck** — the remediation story is as important as the success story
- **Narrates the journey** through LinkedIn posts, blog entries, and discussions

The human does not write application code, approve deployments, or manage daily work. The PM handles strategic prioritization, the PO manages the backlog, and the engineering team executes autonomously.

## Cadence and Cost Management

Agents operate on deliberate intervals, not continuously, to manage token costs:

- **Strategy** (PM, PO): Daily scheduled runs + event-driven dispatch
- **Execution** (Engineer, Reviewer): Event-driven — triggered by dispatch, PR events, or CI results
- **Operations** (SRE, Tech Lead): Scheduled monitoring (every 4h for SRE, scheduled jobs for Tech Lead)
- **Scanning** (UX, Tech Lead scans): Every 3 days

Cadences are tuned based on cost and activity levels. Safety controls (concurrency groups, chain depth limits, review round limits) prevent runaway execution.

## Success Criteria

### The Product Works
- The AI news feed is live and accessible
- New content appears regularly with quality summaries
- The UI is clean and responsive
- The API is stable

### The Orchestration Pattern Is Visible
- The public activity feed shows a clear stream of agent work
- The GitHub repo tells a legible story through issues, PRs, commits, and reviews
- Different agent roles are distinguishable in their contributions
- The end-to-end pattern is evident: planning -> execution -> review -> deployment -> working product

### The Narrative Lands
- A hiring manager visiting for 5 minutes understands what they're seeing
- The repo demonstrates engineering leadership patterns, not just code generation
- Failures, recoveries, and human interventions are visible and tell a good story
- The project stands apart from every other "I built X with AI" demo by showing the full plan-execute-review-deploy pattern with a team of agents
