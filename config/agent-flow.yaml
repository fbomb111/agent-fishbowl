# Agent Flow Graph — Machine-Readable Interaction Topology
#
# This file is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for how agents interact.
# It drives:
#   1. Mermaid diagram generation (docs/agent-flow.md)
#   2. CI validation (scripts/validate-flow.py --validate)
#   3. CI freshness check (docs/agent-flow.md must match)
#
# When adding or modifying agents, update this file FIRST.
# Run: python scripts/validate-flow.py --validate
# Run: python scripts/validate-flow.py --mermaid -o docs/agent-flow.md

version: "2"

# All agent workflows must pin this harness version.

# ─── Event Registry ───────────────────────────────────────────────
# Every repository_dispatch event_type MUST be declared here.
# This prevents event name drift across workflows.
